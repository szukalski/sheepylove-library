# sheepylove-library

This is a KiCad library for the footprints which I use.

I actually use a private repo for my working library, so this is a copy of that. It is probably not up-to-date and comes with no guarantees. That said, it's probably enough for your use cases if you're starting out.

I use [Milk Run from Font Monkey](https://www.fontmonkey.com/) as my go-to font. It is open sourced and full of love.

Much-o love-o, Sheepy D.
